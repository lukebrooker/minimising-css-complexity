- What's our goal? Is it…
  - Write semantic html, use CSS to style it?
  - Write reusable CSS "components"?
- We (usually) don't read CSS
- Goal
  > If I’m reading html, I want to know what the css is going to do. If I’m reading css I want to know what will happen if I apply it to a block of html. — http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/

- How do we think when writing CSS?
  - CSS is a design tool
  - How do other design tools work? (Sketch styles)
- Clean defaults
  - normalize/react-native-for-web - @necolas
- Less CSS is less complex
- Avoid overrides
  - Laziness cascades
  - Not mobile/desktop first, simplest first
- Don't abstract too early
- Design constraints as utils/vars/traits
  - You should be able to design with traits/classes
  - Designing like this makes you think differently
- Techniques/Examples
  - Buttons
  - Layout
    - Text Direction (don't use floats)
  - Theming
- Implementation
  - BEMy
  - Atomic CSS
  - CSS Modules
- Utils/Plugins (https://www.sitepoint.com/improving-the-quality-of-your-css-with-postcss/)
- Things needing improvement
  - Media queries
  - Pseudo-selectors
