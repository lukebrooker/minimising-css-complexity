Minimising CSS Complexity
=========================

Many try to solve CSS complexity and long-term maintenance by using advanced methods of organisation like BEM, OOCSS, SUIT or more recently CSS modules or other forms of CSS in JSâ„¢. While these may be necessary, and choosing a strategy is important, there is a lot of complexity that can be removed regardless of organisational strategy.

There are many CSS techniques/solutions we use today that are overly complicated or simply extraneous, and we use these day in day out without really thinking about why.

This is what this talk is about. Using examples of complex CSS components and design systems, we will deconstruct what the intended outcome was, how it can be simplified and the methods/CSS techniques used to get there.

There will be many CSS tips and tricks included, but hopefully, we will also challenge some fundamental ideas of how to write complex CSS. You will walk away with a better understanding of CSS, and a stronger foundation for building complex design systems with CSS.
